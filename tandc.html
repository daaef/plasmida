            <h3>Training and Consultancy</h3>
                <p>
                    From the 27th February to 4th of March, 2017 featured the “Made in
                    Plateau” Exhibition in collaboration with the GIZ. The event took
                    place at the Crest Hotel, Jos. The Made in Plateau exhibition
                    featured only products and commodities made here on the Plateau.
                    It created a platform for the participants to network within the
                    business community and they were also shown practically how to
                    improve on their packaging and relevant linkages were established
                    for them locally and internationally to sell their products and have
                    relevant access to financing. Another initiative was the training
                    embarked upon for Microfinance institutions and relevant bodies,
                    this has been an integral part of activities the Agency has
                    been embarked upon. The Agency has also promoted the
                    deepening of financial inclusion by establishing a Microfinance Fund
                    deliberately to support MSMEs in the State. Looking at the challenges
                    women and youths face in accessing finance for business expansion,
                    the establishment of the Microfinance Fund is to support MSME’s on
                    the Plateau, further the setting up of the Artisans Job Centre in Jos
                    where the skills of artisans can be strengthened for efficient service
                    delivery and the establishment of the Fadama Microfinance Bank,
                    being the first in Nigeria and West Africa has also been completed.</p>
                <h3>MSME’S DATA BANK</h3>
            <p>
                The development and deployment of a mobile application
                for data capturing of MSME’s on the Plateau. The Agency
                has succeeded in developing a data bank for MSME’s on
                the Plateau that can give you at a glance major
                information about these businesses, their capacity, location
                and Tax identification amongst other information that can
                be acquired. Which is a continuous exercise and ongoing
                for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises.
